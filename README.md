This project is a server based on a hybrid concurrency model, developed in C under a Linux environment. It supports 3to5 players participating in the game through a command-line interface, using a combination of processes (fork) and threads (pthread) architecture to achieve player session isolation and concurrent execution of internal server tasks.
